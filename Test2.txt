This file is the sample text
for cr-separated script format,
readline();
Comment , as same to semicoron-separeted script,
start with '/'-and-'*'	such as /*
so, this part is comment block,
and end with '*'-and-'/' such as */
Then, this part is *not* comment part, and compiled
by CCompiler class object.;Also, we can begin comment with // for one line comment
therefore, this is a script part.
But, when we use cr-separeted script format,
we can use also one-line-comment with semicoron such as ;this is a comment!
and, next line is not comment.
